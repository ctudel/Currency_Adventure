CurrencyQuest
============================
This homework assignment brings together all the concepts we have been introducing and gives you practice working with
them including:
- Layout managers
- Text, images, and audio
- Navigation and routing
- Forms and user input
- Custom widgets
- State management

Objective
---------
Create a Flutter app that converts a real-world currency (US dollars) into fictional currencies from popular books, movies, or games
and allows users to purchase fictional items from that world.

Requirements
------------
### User Interface
* Home Page
    - Display the user's current balance in US dollars
    - Display the user's current inventory (items purchased)
    - A button to allow the user to deposit more money
      * When the button is pressed a popup dialog should prompt for an amount
        * The dialog should only accept positive numbers
        * A confirmation (Ok) and a cancel button
        * If confirmed the amount should add to the user's balance
      * A bottom navigation bar with buttons that takes the user to one of the fictional currency screens
* Fictional Currency Screen
  * Display an image representing the fictional currency (doesn't necessarily have to be authentic)
  * Display the user's current balance in the fictional currency, i.e. current balance * exchange rate (you can make up the exchange rate)
  * At least 3 buttons representing items for purchase
    * Buttons can have text labels but images are preferred
    * If the user presses the button:
      * If there is enough fictional currency the balance is debited in the equivalent dollars, the item is added to the inventory and a confirmation sound is played
      * If there is not enough fictional currency a negative sound is played and nothing else happens
* Title bar
  * A home button that when pressed will take the user to the main screen
    
### Functionality
  - Implement at least 3 fictional currencies (e.g., Galleons from Harry Potter, Credits from Star Wars, etc.)
  - Each fictional currency should have at least 3 items to purchase

### UI
  - Grading will include points for the styling of the app
  - Layouts should be responsive and well-presented (centered, appropriately spaced, etc.)

Guidelines
----------
1. Create a new Flutter project
2. Copy the provided code to the project directory (overwriting the sample source)
3. Come up with your (minimum) 3 fictional currencies each with 3 items for purchase
4. Create a new page in the lib/pages directory for each of your currencies
5. Implement the TODOs in the source code
6. Polish the UI and add error handling
7. Test thoroughly and refactor your code for clarity and efficiency

Submission
----------
Create a zipfile that includes (only) the following:
- Your project lib directory
- Your project pubspec.yaml
- A screen recording of you performing the following actions in your app:
  - Navigating to one fictional currency page
  - Purchasing items until the balance is too low to buy anymore
  - Attempting to purchase an item that costs more than the current balance
  - Returning to the home screen
  - Depositing money into the account

Grading Criteria
----------------
- Functionality: 400 points (see TODO)
- Code quality and organization: 25 points
- User interface style and design: 25 points
